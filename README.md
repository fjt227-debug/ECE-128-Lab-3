# ECE-128-Lab-3
The objective of this lab was to design and implement a Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to 7-segment display on the FPGA board. A 4-bit full adder, specifically a 4-bit ripple carry adder, that cascaded four 1-bit full adders, was used to generate the sum output, which was then passed to the BCD to 7-segment decoder. The 4-bit full adder display served as a top-level module to call the designed system to print a single digit, 0-9, on the FPGA board. Finally, the design was verified through simulation, implemented on the hardware using multiple input cases, and analyzed for FPGA resource utilization. 1.) In the constraint dropdown add the constraint file 2.) Compile project: Create 4 different .vfiles and copy the OneBitFA, FourBitFARippleCarry, BCDtoSevenSegmentDisplay1, and FourBitFullAdderDisplay 3.) Make FourBitFullAdderDisplay the top file in the hierarchy 4.) Run these steps 5.) Generate Bitstream 6.) Copy the testbench to test code before programming the FPGA board 7.) Program the board
